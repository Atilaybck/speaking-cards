    "a": "One rule I disagree with is strict attendance rules at school or workplaces.\n\nSometimes people may not be feeling well or dealing with personal issues, but this is not always taken into consideration.\n\nI believe flexibility is important because results and productivity matter more than being physically present all the time. Allowing remote work or flexible hours can increase motivation and overall performance."
