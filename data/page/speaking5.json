    "a": "I try to stay calm and not react emotionally. First, I listen carefully to understand the root cause of the problem. I believe that most conflicts happen because of misunderstandings or poor communication.\n\nAfter listening, I share my thoughts in a respectful way. If I make a mistake, I take responsibility and focus on fixing it.\n\nMy main goal is to find a solution and keep a healthy relationship, not to win the argument."
