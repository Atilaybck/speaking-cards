    "a": "One time I had to learn quickly was when I started a new project with a tight deadline. I had very limited time to understand new information and use it in my work. At first, it was stressful and overwhelming.\n\nHowever, I focused on the most important parts and learned step by step. In the end, I managed to complete the task on time, and this experience taught me how to adapt quickly and stay calm under pressure."
