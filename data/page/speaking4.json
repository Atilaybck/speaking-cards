    "a": "One time I took a risk was when I invested in cryptocurrency for the first time. I didn’t have much knowledge about the market and cryptocurrencies, so there was a risk of losing money. Still, I decided to start with a small amount of money and learn by experience.\n\nThis experience increased my awareness of financial responsibility and risk management."
