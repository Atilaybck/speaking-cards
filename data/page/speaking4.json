    "a": "One of my favorite habits is running regularly. I usually go for a run in the late afternoon, about four or five times a week. After a busy day at work, running is a great way for me to relieve stress and clear my mind.\n\nIt helps me disconnect from everything and just focus on myself. I feel like I reset my brain during each run and always come back home feeling more relaxed and refreshed.\n\nI usually run in a pine forest near my home. I run for about an hour, which is roughly eight kilometers. Being in nature also makes the experience more peaceful and enjoyable. That is why running is not just good for my body, but also for my mental well-being."
