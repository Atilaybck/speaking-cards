    "a": "One challenging situation I faced was starting a new project without knowing whether it would pay off or not. There was no clear roadmap, and I had limited resources and time.\n\nI handled it by progressing step by step, learning from experience, and adjusting my strategy when circumstances changed.\n\nAlthough it was stressful at first, the experience helped me build my confidence and strengthen my problem-solving skills."
