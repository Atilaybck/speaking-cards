    "a": "One of the most important things I have learned these days is that keeping a positive mindset has a strong impact on my daily life.\n\nEven when situations don’t go as planned, focusing on the positive side, from a stoic point of view, helps me stay motivated and find solutions instead of problems.\n\nI also realized that positivity is contagious; when I stay calm and optimistic, it creates a more constructive and supportive atmosphere around me."
