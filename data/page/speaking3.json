    "a": "One thing I find difficult is keeping a consistent sleep schedule. Sometimes I go to bed late, and other days I have to wake up early, which makes my sleep irregular.\n\nAs a result, I often feel tired and unfocused during the day. This also affects my productivity and mood. I am trying to improve this by setting a fixed bedtime and reducing phone use at night."
