    "q": "Have you ever been abroad? If yes, where did you go?",
    "a": "Yes, I went to Malta a few years ago. It was my first time visiting Malta, so I was very excited. I preferred to go alone because I enjoy discovering new places by myself.\n\nMalta is a beautiful island with amazing sea views and historic places. I spent a lot of time walking around the city and enjoying the weather, which was sunny and warm.\n\nI also visited some historical sites, such as Mdina and St. John’s Cathedral, and tried local Maltese food. It was a great experience, and I would like to visit again."
