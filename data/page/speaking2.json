    "q": "What do you think about living in different countries?",
    "a": "I think living in different countries is a great way to grow both personally and professionally. When you experience a new culture, you learn different perspectives, habits, and ways of life.\n\nIt helps you become more open-minded and adaptable. You also improve your language skills and build confidence by facing new challenges on your own.\n\nOf course, it can be difficult at first because everything is unfamiliar, but over time it becomes a valuable experience. Overall, I believe living in another country teaches you a lot about the world and about yourself too."
